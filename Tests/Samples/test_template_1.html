Dear #######,

You have received this communication because your direct report employee #######  is terminated but is still listed as the Solid Line Manager/Responsible in ZIM for one or multiple contracts.  Please see below (or attached) report for identities/contracts that require immediate attention.

To comply with our security procedures and audit requirements and to support the approval process, all contracts/identities must have an active Solid Line Manager/Responsible in ZIM. Without an active manager the BMC-Remedy/ZIM/AnGeBer requests for permissions, hardware, software etc., will never be approved and fulfilled.  Therefore, we need your assistance to identify the new Solid Line Manager/Responsible.

Please provide the name and the user ID for the Solid Line Manager/Responsible and we will make the required change in ZIM.

To avoid any technical issues when we transfer the ownership, the new Solid Line Manager/Responsible must be from the same department/sitecode  #######

Please note, the change for Engagement contracts (internal employees) must be done in MHS. Please check the attached report if any Engagement contracts are listed and contact your local HR team to make the required change.  

For additional information regarding external and generic contracts consult the Documentation listed below.
